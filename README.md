Code Examples From Introduction to JavaScript Object Notation: A To-the-Point Guide to JSON

![alt tag](https://github.com/lindsaybassett/json/blob/master/json.jpg)

This repository has been created to be used with the book Introduction to JavaScript Object Notation.  It is provided as an alternative to copying and pasting examples for eBook readers, and hand typing examples for paper-back readers.  Additionally, many snippets of code from the book have been added to a complete code file (such as an HTML file) to form a working example and save you from having to build the examples from scratch.  

Many examples require an internet connection.  If an example is not working for you, please check that you are connected to the internet before reporting an issue.

Many examples rely on a connection to a third party site, such as Open Weather Map API.  If an example is not working for you, please check for a third party URL in the example and test its availability before reporting an issue.

The examples in the book are labeled with the structure "Example [Chapter]-[Example Number]."  An example labeled "Example 2-5" means that it is example number 5 in chapter 2.  So, to find the corresponding example in this repository, you would need to look in the Chapter02 directory and find the file labeled "Example05."

Some examples in the book build upon one another to form a complete example.  In this repository, these examples have been combined into a single file.
